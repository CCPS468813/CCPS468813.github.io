   <h1>About Me</h1>
   <p>I want to own my own auto-mechanics shop. I enjoy cars and the complexity of how they work. I love learning about each of the different parts and how they work together. A lot of people in my family work on cars and when I was younger I would sit and watch them work.

I still watch when people work on cars and I'm always asking questions about what they are doing. I've worked on my people skills and I've done entrepreneurship tests which helps me be prepared. 

I think values like respect and kindness are important. You also have to be understanding. It is important because you have to understand what your client wants or needs and you have to figure out what the best solution would be.

Some goals I want to achieve now is getting my GPA higher and getting better grades. I want to get them better so I have more experience. I also want to get a part-time job so I can get the experience of working with others.

I want to be known for being reliable and efficient. If I can do well running a business I want people to know.</p>
